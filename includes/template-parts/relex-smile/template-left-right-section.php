                            On the day of your ReLEx SMILE surgery, we advise you to not wear any make up and be
                            accompanied by a relative or friend who can assist you home afterwards. When you arrive at
                            your appointment, you will be shown into our private laser suite where our friendly surgical
                            staff will be waiting for you. A small drop of anesthetic is placed on your eye and we
                            provide comfortable equipment support for your eyelids so there is no need to worry about
                            blinking.

                            The surgeon will be giving you easy instructions throughout the process and guide you
                            through the procedure to make your treatment smooth and accurate. You will be asked to stare
                            at a green flashing light to hold your gaze in the correct place. The robotic laser machine
                            will slowly manoeuvre you into the exact position needed while you stare at the green light.
                            It will then make gentle contact with your eye. The ReLEx SMILE laser process takes
                            approximately 25 seconds. After this, you can sit up and begin to check out your new vision.

                                There is nothing more important than our patients feeling comfortable after their
                                procedure. We advise a one-week recovery period before resuming any exercise or driving.

                                Our team will always be at the end of a phone call throughout your recovery at home to
                                answer any more questions you may have. In your aftercare appointment, your laser
                                specialist will check the improvement of your vision before you can enjoy your new life
                                without contact lenses and glasses!
